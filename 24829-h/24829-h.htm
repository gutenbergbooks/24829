<div class="new-h2">&nbsp;</div>
<h2>HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The first types were cut in imitation of the Gothic or
black letter handwriting employed at that period in
copying Bibles, missals, and the like. It was large and
angular and the lines were very coarse and black. These
peculiarities gave it the name. Its characteristics made it
easy to read even in the dim light of a church or by the
failing eyes of the aged. This form of type, however, was
only suitable for large pages. When reduced in size it
became very difficult to read, being an almost indistinguishable
blur on the page.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;">
<img src="images/mazarin_bible.png" width="433" height="376" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">Type of the Mazarin Bible (exact size).</span>
</div>

<p>The cost of materials and the unwieldiness of the great
folio volumes soon caused a demand for smaller books.
Gutenberg's 36-line Bible was almost immediately replaced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
by the 42-line Bible. A reduction of one sixth in the number
of pages of a book as large as the Bible would effect a
very important saving in the cost of material and labor,
especially when we remember that the early printing press
was a very laborious and slow affair. Gutenberg's press
was capable of printing only twenty sheets an hour, or one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
sheet every three minutes. The invention of the movable
bed, about the year 1500, increased the output of the press
to two hundred sheets an hour. In 1786 the speed had
risen only to two hundred and fifty sheets an hour. Cheap
printing waited for the application of power to machinery.</p>

<p>The big book with the big type was well enough for
churches and libraries. But the purpose of printing was
soon seen to be the spread of intelligence through the
popularizing of literature. Books were to be placed in the
hands of the people, not simply of the priests, nobles, and
professional men. That end could only be accomplished
by making books cheap and portable, that is to say small.
To this end the printers soon addressed themselves to the
task of devising forms of type which should be smaller, so
as to reduce the number and size of pages required for a
book without sacrifice of legibility. A clear, clean cut type,
with sharp lines and simple forms, capable of compression
without loss of distinction, was the great need.</p>

<p>The first important departure was the cutting of Roman
type. The capitals were imitated from the letter forms
used in Roman inscriptions. In the earlier forms the lower-case
letters were rough and uncouth, much resembling the
Gothic forms. The inventor of this form is not known,
but it was certainly employed by the German printers
Sweynheim and Pannartz at Subiaco, near Rome, as early
as 1467. Their example was followed by several imitators
and improvers, but its form was not definitely settled until
Nicholas Jenson cast his fonts in Venice in 1470 or 1471.
It is doubtful if any more perfect Roman types than those
of Jenson have ever been produced. The superiority of
this type soon caused its general adoption except in Germany.
England was slow in coming into line. Caxton
never used anything but Gothic type. Roman type was not
introduced into England at all until 1509, and then had to
make its way against the older forms backed by English
conservatism. Germany has never adopted the Roman letter
for general use but makes some use of it in scientific works.</p>

<span class="caption">Roman type of Nicholas Jenson, 1472 (exact size).</span>
</div>

<p>The next step was the invention of Italic types by Aldus
Manutius, of Venice, in 1501. He took for his model the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
handwriting of the poet Petrarch and produced a type not
essentially different from the modern Italic. Originally the
Italic letters were lower-case only, Roman capitals being
retained. The incongruousness of this combination was,
however, so evident that Italic capitals were soon designed
and then the new fonts were complete. The Aldine capitals
used with Italic lower-case were small, the ancestors of
the small capitals of today. Aldus used the Italic type as a
text letter, and such use continued frequent for a century.</p>

<img src="images/aldine_virgil.png" width="600" height="494" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">Type of the Aldine Virgil, 1501 (exact size).</span>
</div>

<p>At the present day, except in Germany, the three forms
of type have their distinct uses. Gothic, variously known
as Black Letter, Old English, Priory Text, Cloister, etc., is
used only for special work, particularly in ecclesiastical
printing. The modern type called "gothic" is not derived
from it. Roman is the general text letter. Italic has ceased
to be a text letter, but serves a useful purpose for certain
special uses which are to be considered at length in the
following pages.</p>



<div class="new-h2">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>
<h2>RULES FOR THE USE OF ITALIC</h2>


<p>Italic has, in general, four uses:</p>

<ol>
<li>for emphasis.</li>

<li>to set off a title, word, or passage from the context.</li>

<li>for running titles, sub-heads, the headings of tables,
and other like places where something different
from the text letter seems needed for variety.</li>

<li>for display purposes in commercial work.</li>
</ol>

<p>One very important principle should always be observed
in the use of italic for emphasis. Emphasis should always
be used sparingly. Make the words do their work. Do not
try to supplement poverty of thought and weakness of expression
by italics, capitals, and other marks of emphasis.
Where there is too much emphasis attempted no emphasis
is secured. This fault was much more common formerly
than now.</p>

<p>The accompanying reproduction of a page from a book
printed in 1690 (place not given, but probably London)
illustrates several of the faulty uses of italics common at
that time. An entire paragraph is italicized (quite unnecessarily)
for emphasis. All proper names and adjectives
derived from them are italicized where they occur in the
regular text and printed in roman where they occur in
italicized passages. Note the frequent capitalization for emphasis
and especially the italic capital with roman lower-case
in the first line of the second paragraph. This is a frequent
usage in this particular book. In this book all quotations
are printed in italic without quote marks. The paper,
composition, and presswork of the book are very poor. It
represents English printing in its worst period.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 354px;">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
<img src="images/book_1690.png" width="354" height="600" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">Page from a book of 1690.<br/>(The slurred appearance represents the printing of the original copy.)</span>
</div>

<p>Moderation in the use of italics is so important that in
many cases the compositor is justified in ignoring markings
for italic in his copy where they are too profuse. The
author is often surprised and disappointed at the appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of his proof when it comes back heavily italicized. Moreover
the occurrence of many italics increases the cost of
composition because of the greater labor involved.</p>


<p class="rule">I. Italicize, subject to the caution just given, any words
or phrases which it is desired to emphasize.</p>


<p class="rule">II. Foreign words and phrases incorporated into English
sentences are sometimes italicized and sometimes not so
distinguished. The deciding element in fixing the usage in
these cases would seem to be the commonness and familiarity
of the word or phrase. For example, the meaning of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</i> (Latin), <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">menu</i> (French), <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">recto</i> (Italian), or <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">stein</i>
(German) are as well known as those of most English
words. To all intents and purposes these words have been
adopted into our language. On the other hand, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d'esprit</i>
(French) or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</i> (Latin) would probably not be immediately
understood by the casual reader. Words of the
first type should not be italicized. Words of the second
type should be.</p>

<p>Following is a partial list of words of foreign origin
which should not be italicized even when the original
accents are retained. It is better to retain the accents.
They are, however, often omitted. Familiarity plays its
part here also. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D&eacute;nouement</i> is very often written without
the accent; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">n&eacute;e</i> is rarely so written. The absence of
accented letters from typewriters, from ordinary fonts of
type, and from the matrices ordinarily used in type-casting
machines probably contributes largely to their omission.</p>

When an unfamiliar foreign word is used to convey precise
description, put it in italic, but use roman for repetition
of the word.</p>

<p>Italicize brief passages of foreign words which may be
incorporated into an English passage but may not be long
enough to be treated as regular quotations.</p>

<blockquote><p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De gustibus non est disputandum</i>, or as the French have it,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chacun a son gout</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Longer passages in foreign languages should be set in
roman.</p>

<p>To set an entire paragraph of quoted matter in a foreign
language in italic, or even to use italic too freely for phrases,
practically nullifies the value of it as a display letter for the
sub-headings or for any other part of the book in which distinction
is really needed. Quotation marks, indention,
smaller type, or any of the marks which distinguish quoted
matter are sufficient.</p>


<p class="rule">III. At one time it was quite customary to set all quotations,
whether in English or a foreign language, prose or
verse, in italics, but that fashion is now happily obsolete.
Some modern printers use italic for bits of verse between
paragraphs in the text of roman, but it is a fancy and not
likely to be permanent.</p>


<p class="rule">IV. Do not italicize foreign titles preceding names of
foreign institutions or places, streets, etc., the meaning or
position of which in English would call for roman type.</p>

<blockquote><p><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pere Ladeau</span>; <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Freiherr von Schwenau</span>; the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place de la
Concorde</span>; the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Museo delle Terme</span>.</p></blockquote>


<p class="rule">V. In text matter use roman for the name of any author,
but italicize the title of the work. This applies to books,
including plays, essays, cycles of poems, and single poems
of considerable length, usually printed separately, and not
from the context understood to form parts of a larger volume;
pamphlets, treatises, tracts, documents, and periodicals
(including regularly appearing proceedings and transactions).
In the case of newspapers and periodicals the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
name of the place of publication should be italicized when
it forms an integral part of the name, but do not under
ordinary circumstances italicize the article <i>the</i>.</p>

<p>In many offices the names of papers, magazines, and
serials are not italicized. Roman is often used without
quotation marks, the title being indicated by capitalization.
When such names are used as credits at the end of citations
or notes they should always be italicized.</p>

<p>This is largely a matter of individual taste and office
style. Ample warrant can be found for either form in the
writing of the best authorities and in the practice of the
best offices.</p>


<p class="rule">VI. In citations which make a full paragraph, and in
footnotes, the name of both author and book are commonly
set in roman lower-case. At the end of a paragraph
or footnote specification of author and book may be roman
for author and italic for book. When only the book is
given, use italics.</p>

<p>These rules are often modified in long bibliographical
lists, tables, or other cases when following them would
cause a great accumulation of italics and spoil the appearance
of a page. Do not italicize the books of the Bible
(canonical or apocryphal) or titles of ancient manuscripts,
or symbols used to designate manuscripts.</p>

<p class="center">D&nbsp;16, M&nbsp;6, P, J.</p>


<p class="rule">VII. Italicize <i>see</i> and <i>see also</i>, in indices and similar compilations
when they are used for cross-reference, and when
it is desirable to differentiate them from the context.</p>


<p class="rule">VIII. Italicize <i>for</i> and <i>read</i> in lists of errata to separate
the incorrect from the correct.</p>

<p class="center">Page&nbsp;999 <i>for</i> Henry <i>read</i> Henri.</p>


<p class="rule">IX. The phrases <i>prima facie</i> and <i>ex officio</i> are sometimes
used to qualify the nouns which follow, and sometimes
used as adverbs. As qualifiers they are often printed in
roman with the hyphen.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Prima-facie evidence.<br />
An ex-officio member of all committees.</p></blockquote>

<p>When used as adverbs they may be printed in italics
without the hyphen.</p>

<blockquote><p>The evidence is, <i>prima facie</i>, convincing.<br />
The speaker is, <i>ex officio</i>, the chairman.</p></blockquote>


<p class="rule">X. Names of ships, especially when they are taken from
places, as in the United States Navy, are often italicized.</p>

<p class="center">U.S.S. <i>Philadelphia</i>, U.S.S. <i>Alabama</i>.</p>


<p class="rule">XI. Names of paintings, statues, musical compositions,
and characters in plays are sometimes italicized. This is
not ordinarily advisable. It violates the rule of never using
italics or other emphasizing devices needlessly and is liable
to mar the appearance of the page. It is sometimes necessary,
however, to avoid ambiguity. For example, Julius
Caesar is a historical personage, "Julius Caesar" is one of
Shakespeare's plays, <i>Julius Caesar</i> is a character in the play.</p>


<p class="rule">XII. Italicize the symbols <i>a)</i>, <i>b)</i>, <i>c)</i>, etc., used to indicate
subdivisions when beginning a paragraph and <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>,
etc., affixed to the number of verse, page, etc., to denote
a fractional part.</p>

<blockquote style="width: 11em; margin: auto;">
<p>See Chap.&nbsp;iii, sec.&nbsp;2&nbsp;<i>a)</i>.<br/>
Luke&nbsp;4&nbsp;:&nbsp;31&nbsp;<i>b</i>.</p>
</blockquote>


<p class="rule">XIII. Italicize letters used to designate quantities, lines,
etc., in algebraic, geometrical, and similar matter, and in
explanation of diagrams and illustrations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(<i>a</i>+<i>b</i>)<sup>2</sup>=<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>+2<i>ab</i>+<i>b</i><sup>2</sup>; the line <i>a c</i>=the line <i>a b</i>;
the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> power; at the point <i>B</i>.</p>
</blockquote>


<p class="rule">XIV. Italicize particular letters of the alphabet when
referred to as such.</p>

<p class="center">We use <i>a</i> much more frequently than <i>q</i>.</p>


<p class="rule"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
XV. Authorities in science differ in the use of italics
and capitals. In strictly scientific matter it is better to
follow copy if the copy is intelligently prepared; if not,
follow some recognized text-book on the subject.</p>

<p>In general the following rules will be found serviceable.</p>

<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>In botanical, zoological, geological, and paleontological
matter, italicize scientific (Latin) names of genera
and species when used together (the generic name being
in the nominative singular), and of the genera only, when
used alone. When genera and species are used together
the genus always comes first, species second.</p>

<blockquote lang="la" xml:lang="la"><p><i>Agaricus Campestris</i>, <i>Felis leo</i>, <i>Conodectes favosus</i>, <i>Phyteuma
Halleri</i>, <i>Pinus</i>, <i>Basidiabolus</i>, <i>Alternaria</i>, <i>Erythrosuchus</i>.</p></blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>In medical matter the general practice is to print
names of diseases and remedies in roman. In the <i>Encyclopedia
Britannica, Eleventh Edition</i>, however, the scientific
names of diseases are printed in italics.</p>
</li>

<li><p>In astronomical and astrophysical matter italicize:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The lower-case letters designating certain Fraunhofer
lines: <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>.</p>
</li>

<li><p>The lower-case letters used by Baeyer to designate
certain stars in constellations for which the Greek letters
have been exhausted: <i>f</i>, Tauri; <i>u</i>, Hercules.</p>
</li></ol></li>

<li><p>Italic should not be used for:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Greek, Latin, and Arabic names of planets, satellites,
constellations, and individual stars: Neptune, Thetys,
Orionis.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Symbols for chemical elements: H. Ca. Ti.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Capital letters given by Fraunhofer to the lines of the
spectrum: A&ndash;H, K.</p>
</li>

<li><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Letters designating the special types of stars: A&nbsp;5,
B&nbsp;3, Mb.</p>
</li>

<li><p>The capital letter H with different Greek subscript
letters, used to designate symbols of hydrogen: H<sub>a</sub>, H<sub>b</sub>, etc.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Designations of celestial objects in well-known catalogues;
also the Flamstead numbers:</p>

<blockquote><p>M&nbsp;13 (for No.&nbsp;13 of Messier's <i>Catalogue of Nebulae
and Clusters</i>), Bond&nbsp;619; N.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;C. 6165; B.&nbsp;D.-18&deg;&nbsp;4871;
85&nbsp;Pegasi, Lalande&nbsp;5761.</p></blockquote>

<p>But when initials are used to express the titles of catalogues,
as such, and not to designate a particular celestial
object, such initials are to be italicized, following the usual
rule of references by titles.</p>

<p class="center"><i>B.&nbsp;D.</i>; <i>N.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;C.</i></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<p class="rule">XVI. In resolutions italicize the word "<i>Resolved</i>," but
not the word "Whereas."</p>


<p class="rule">XVII. Italicize the names of plaintiff and defendant in
the citation of legal cases; also the titles of proceedings containing
such prefixes as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in re</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</i>, <i>In the matter of</i>, etc.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The Boston Elevated Railway Co.</i> vs. <i>The City of Cambridge</i>.
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In re</span> Johnson</i>; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</span> Thomas</i>; <i>In the matter of
the petition of John Smith for a change of venue</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p class="rule">XVIII. Italicize address lines in speeches, reports, etc.,
and primary address lines in letters. Set the address flush,
in a separate line, with the nouns capitalized.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentlemen.</i><br/>
<i>Mr. Henry&nbsp;P. Porter, 148&nbsp;High St., Boston, Mass.</i></p>
</blockquote>


<p class="rule">XIX. In signatures italicize the position or title added
after the name. If this consists of only one word, it is
usually run into the same line with the name.</p>

<p class="center">Frederick&nbsp;W. Hamilton, <i>Clerk</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
If the title consists of more than one word but is no
longer than the name, center the first letter under the name
line, and indent one em on the right.</p>

<p class="center">John&nbsp;F. Fitzgerald,<br/>
<span style="margin-left: 7em;"><i>Mayor of Boston</i>.</span></p>

<p>If the title is longer than the name, center the name over
the second line and set this flush:</p>

<p class="center">Minton&nbsp;P. Warren,<br/>
<i>Professor of Latin Language and Literature</i>.</p>

<p>Sometimes a long title may be set in a smaller type, or,
if this is not advisable, it may be put into two lines.</p>

<p>These rules are generally sound, but may have to be
varied to suit special conditions.</p>

<p>Italicize the signatures of contributors to magazines, etc.,
when the names appear at the end of the article. If the
name appears at the head of the article use small capitals,
or, as is often done, the same type as the text.</p>


<p class="rule">XX. Italic may be used to distinguish the words or
clauses which serve as verbal texts for an extended comment.
In printed sermons, for example, the text is often
set in italics.</p>


<p class="rule">XXI. Italic may be used with good effect for running
titles, for table headings, and for sub-heads. It is not desirable
for side notes. It has many kerned letters which are
liable to break off at the ends of the lines in an exposed
position.</p>


<p class="rule">XXII. In the English Bible italics are used to print words
which are not expressed in the original Hebrew or Greek but
are implied in the original and expressed in the translation.</p>

<blockquote><p>Their quiver <i>is</i> an open sepulchre; they <i>are</i> all mighty
men.</p>

<p>I find in him no fault <i>at all</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>These italics should never be mistaken for marks of
emphasis.</p>


<p class="rule"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
XXIII. Care should be taken that the italic type used
should mate well with the roman. The fact that it often
did not so mate, even in fonts supposed to go together,
was one cause for the disfavor which came to attend its use.
Typesetting machines constructed without proper provision
for the composition of italic have been very influential in
restricting its use. Italics are now practically abolished from
newspaper work except in advertising matter, though they
were used in newspapers to excess in the eighteenth century.</p>


<p class="rule">XXIV. Italics are indicated in manuscript by drawing a
single line under the words to be so printed.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.9em;">As elsewhere in this section of the Typographic Technical Series,
the learning of the rules must be supplemented by extended practice
in their application. Constant drill should be given the apprentice in
the setting of matter requiring the use of italics, or in writing out
manuscripts with the italics properly indicated. There is no other
way in which accuracy and practical proficiency can be acquired.
Printed matter may be shown for criticism and discussion, and incorrectly
italicized matter may be given out for correction.</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 1.3em;">TYPOGRAPHIC TECHNICAL SERIES
FOR APPRENTICES</h1>


<p>The following list of publications, comprising the <span class="smcap">Typographic
Technical Series for Apprentices</span>, has been prepared
under the supervision of the Committee on Education of the
United Typothetae of America for use in trade classes, in course of
printing instruction, and by individuals.</p>

<p>Each publication has been compiled by a competent author or
group of authors, and carefully edited, the purpose being to provide
the printers of the United States&mdash;employers, journeymen,
and apprentices&mdash;with a comprehensive series of handy and
inexpensive compendiums of reliable, up-to-date information upon
the various branches and specialties of the printing craft, all
arranged in orderly fashion for progressive study.</p>

<p>The publications of the series are of uniform size, 5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;8 inches.
Their general make-up, in typography, illustrations, etc., has
been, as far as practicable, kept in harmony throughout. A brief
synopsis of the particular contents and other chief features of each
volume will be found under each title in the following list.</p>

<p>Each topic is treated in a concise manner, the aim being to
embody in each publication as completely as possible all the
rudimentary information and essential facts necessary to an understanding
of the subject. Care has been taken to make all statements
accurate and clear, with the purpose of bringing essential
information within the understanding of beginners in the different
fields of study. Wherever practicable, simple and well-defined
drawings and illustrations have been used to assist in giving
additional clearness to the text.</p>

<p>In order that the pamphlets may be of the greatest possible
help for use in trade-school classes and for self-instruction, each
title is accompanied by a list of Review Questions covering
essential items of the subject matter. A short Glossary of technical
terms belonging to the subject or department treated is also
added to many of the books.</p>

<p>These are the Official Text-books of the United Typothetae of
America.</p>

<h2 class="section">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h2>


<p>This series of Typographic Text-books is the result of the
splendid co-operation of a large number of firms and individuals
engaged in the printing business and its allied industries
in the United States of America.</p>

<p>The Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of
America, under whose auspices the books have been prepared and
published, acknowledges its indebtedness for the generous assistance
rendered by the many authors, printers, and others identified
with this work.</p>

<p>While due acknowledgment is made on the title and copyright
pages of those contributing to each book, the Committee nevertheless
felt that a group list of co-operating firms would be of
interest.</p>

<p>The following list is not complete, as it includes only those who
have co-operated in the production of a portion of the volumes,
constituting the first printing. As soon as the entire list of books
comprising the Typographic Technical Series has been completed
(which the Committee hopes will be at an early date), the full list
will be printed in each volume.</p>

<p>The Committee also desires to acknowledge its indebtedness to
the many subscribers to this Series who have patiently awaited its
publication.</p>
